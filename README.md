# ExCCCRender

## How to build

If you want to build ExCCCRender, you need to install the following third-party libries:
- Vulkan (Recommand)



ExCCCRender uses cmake to build and used lots of C++20 feature. So please check your cmake version and C++ standard (Maybe C++23, I'll try)
- CMake version 3.20 at least
- C++ compiler should support C++20
